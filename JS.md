# Javacsript tests

For the following tests you can use JSFiddle or another tool to execute.

1. Execute an array of asynchronous functions which returns a promise, one after the other in sequence.  
  - Asynchronous functions can be executed and promises can be captured in an array.  
  - Print the final result of every promise regardless of whether or not one rejects.

2. Execute 3 asynchronous functions one after the other in sequence using async await
  - Async function with await for each promise can be used to execute in sequence

2. Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome. Print result.
